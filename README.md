California House Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in California using a dataset from the California Housing Data. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of five different machine learning algorithms. The goal is to compare these algorithms to determine which one provides the best predictions based on key performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² (coefficient of determination).

Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of each model and generate comparison charts.
python src/evaluation.py
Jupyter Notebooks:

Alternatively, you can explore the project interactively using the Jupyter notebooks provided in the notebooks/ directory.
Machine Learning Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset:

Linear Regression: A basic model assuming a linear relationship between the features and the target.
Ridge Regression: A regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
XGBoost Regressor: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm that provides better performance and flexibility.
AdaBoost Regressor: Another boosting technique that combines weak learners to create a strong learner.
Evaluation
Each model was evaluated based on:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the average magnitude of the error in predictions.
R² (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
The models were compared using these metrics on both the training and testing datasets.

Results
After evaluating the models, the following results were obtained:

Linear Regression: RMSE = X, R² = X
Ridge Regression: RMSE = X, R² = X
Random Forest Regressor: RMSE = X, R² = X
XGBoost Regressor: RMSE = X, R² = X
AdaBoost Regressor: RMSE = X, R² = X
(The specific results should be filled in based on your project's outcomes.)

Conclusion
The XGBoost Regressor provided the best performance among the models tested, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest R² on the test dataset. This suggests that XGBoost was the most effective at capturing the complex patterns in the data, making it the preferred model for this dataset.
